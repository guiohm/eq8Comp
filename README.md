# eq8
>Pronounced 'equate'

**eq8** is a web browser plugin (uses the [Web Extensions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions)) that 
brings a full-fledged parametric equalizer right to your browser. This allows you to equalize all of the HTML5 Audio/Video elements to your 
liking: YouTube&trade; videos, in-browser mp3's, etc. eq8 was inspired by Ableton&reg; Live&trade;'s awesome EQ Eight equalizer, and works 
similarly.

There are some excellent videos online detailing how to use an equalizer.
