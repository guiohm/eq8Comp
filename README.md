# eq8
>Pronounced 'equate'

**eq8** is a web browser plugin (uses the [Web Extensions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions)) that 
brings a full-fledged parametric equalizer right to your browser. This allows you to equalize all of the HTML5 Audio/Video elements on any
web page to your liking: YouTube&trade; videos, in-browser mp3's, etc. eq8 was inspired by Ableton&reg; Live&trade;'s awesome EQ Eight 
equalizer, and works similarly.

If you're feeling lost, there are some excellent videos online detailing how to effectively use an equalizer. That being said, I encourage
you to play around with the plugin, because it's actually a lot of fun messing with the sounds in real-time.
